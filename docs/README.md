Croc v0.1.0 Documentation
=========================

Croc is a self-hosted solution for creating complex integrations with various
web services using web hooks.

Incoming web hooks trigger user defined Node.js scripts in Croc. Scripts are run
in a seperate process and have the full power of Node.js behind them. You can
even import core modules as well as third-party modules found on the npm
registry.
