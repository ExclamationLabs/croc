Modules
=======

In addition to core Node.js modules, hooks in Croc also support third-party
modules installed via the npm registry. Installation of third-party modules is
limited to admin users.


## Installing & Deleting

Modules can be installed via the user interface under the "Modules" tab on the
settings page. On the left side of the page is a list of all currently installed
modules that are available to hooks. Below each module name is a button to
delete it. This will completely remove the module from your system.

To install a new modules, enter the name of the modules you want in the form on
the left. After hitting enter, Croc will search the npm registry and display
detailed information about that module. To add the module hit the "add" button.
Once installed, the module will be immediately available for use in hooks.
