System Settings
===============

Croc currently only has a couple settings that are configurable via the user
interface. System settings can be found under the "System" tab found on the
settings page.

#### Domain

The domain settings is used to output the endpoint for a hook. It should be
either an IP address or a FQDN.


#### Script Timeout

This is the duration (in milliseconds) for which the hook will run before it is
stopped automatically. **Default**: 10000 (10 seconds).
